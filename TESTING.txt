Tests can be found under /pyTests and /dfa_to_min_dfa

pyTests directory contains several files:
1. /dfa_images
2. /nfa_images
3. dfa.py
4. nfa.py
5. test_setters.py

1. Contains .png images for each dfa test case found in dfa.py
2. Contains .png images for each nfa test case found in nfa.py
3. Test suite for dfa graphical representation
    - contains 10 tests with 4 "stress tests" simply to test the bounds and constraints of the code
    
4. Test suite for nfa graphical representation
    - contains 10 tests with 4 "stress tests" simply to test the bounds and constraints of the code

5. Small test suite to test the datatypes
    - regex setter
    - nfa setter

dfa_to_min_dfa contains several files:
1. test_cases.py: contains the code to run all 10 test cases (which also produce the images found under pyTests/mini_images)
2. main.py, disjoint_set.py: helper functions for minimizing
